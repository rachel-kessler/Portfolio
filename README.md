# Portfolio - Rachel Kessler
Welcome to my data science portfolio! 

Here I have compiled a running list of my current and previous projects. I have provided a summary below, in addition to the code attached.

For additional questions, information, or examples of my work, I can be reached at rachelkessler48@gmail.com.

## Digit Classification using the MNIST Dataset
* Stack: Python, SciKit-Learn
* Summary: Tested various machine learning classification models in order to predict handwritten digits using the MNIST datasest. Models utilized and analyzed include: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees. A 5-fold cross validation was used to optimize the hyperparameters.

## US Election Predictions and County Demographics
* Stack: Python, Statsmodels
* Summary: Cleaned US demographic data, conducted an exploratory data anaysis, fit regression models on county demographics and republican vote share, and conducted forward feature selection to optimize the model fit.

## Montreal Bike Sharing Analysis
* Stack: SQL
* Summary: Conducted an analysis of 10+ million Bixi bike sharing trips in Montreal using MySQL.

## In Progress: Capstone Project - Customer Value Predictions and Segmentation
* Stack: Python, SciKit-Learn, XGBoost, Tableau
* In partnership with a local B2B business, machine learning models are used in the following ways:
     * Marketing Strategy: Fit an unsupervised K-Means model for customer features (including demographics and purchase history) resulting in a segmented approach to marketing (Ex: Price incentives for Churned Best Customers).
     * Sales Strategy: Develop supervised classification models to predict if customers are within top 20% (using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost). False positives are minimized in order to ensure sales budget isn’t spent on customers who won’t provide a high ROI.
