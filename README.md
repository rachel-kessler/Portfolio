# Portfolio - Rachel Kessler
Welcome to my data science portfolio! 

Here I have compiled a running list of my current and previous projects. I have provided a summary below, in addition to the code attached.

For additional questions, information, or examples of my work, I can be reached at rachelkessler48@gmail.com.

## Digit Classification using the MNIST Dataset
* Stack: Python, SciKit-Learn
* Summary: Tested various machine learning classification models in order to predict handwritten digits using the MNIST datasest. Models utilized and analyzed include: Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees. A 5-fold cross validation was used to optimize the hyperparameters.

## US Election Predictions and County Demographics
* Stack: Python, Statsmodels
* Summary: Cleaned US demographic data, conducted an exploratory data anaysis, fit regression models on county demographics and republican vote share, and conducted forward feature selection to optimize the model fit.

## Montreal Bike Sharing Analysis
* Stack: SQL
* Summary: Conducted an analysis of 10+ million Bixi bike sharing trips in Montreal using MySQL.

## Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
* Stack: SQL, Tableau
* Summary: Analyzed success of various 300,000+ Kickstarter campaigns in order to provide insights into the success of various campaigns. Created a simple interactive Tableau dashboard to showcase results. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/shared/839GZNK9N?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link">View the dashboard here</a>

## Capstone Project - Customer Value Predictions and Segmentation
* Stack: Python, SciKit-Learn, XGBoost, Plotly
* In partnership with a local B2B manufacturing business, machine learning models were developed in the following ways:
     * Marketing Strategy: An unsupervised K-Means model was fit on customer value attributes resulting in a segmented approach to marketing (Ex: Price incentives for Churned Best Customers). The clusters were used to understand shared characteristics amongst the segments.
     * Sales Strategy: A supervised classification model was developed to predict if potential new customers will contribute an annual revenue greater than $5000 (using Logistic Regression and XGBoost classifiers). The models hyperparameters were optimized by minimizing false positives (maximizing precision) in order to ensure sales budget isn’t spent on customers who won’t provide a high ROI. The resulting model helps the company take a list of sales leads and narrow the focus down to key accounts.
