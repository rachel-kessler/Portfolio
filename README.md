# Portfolio - Rachel Kessler
Welcome to my data science portfolio! 

Here I have compiled a running list of my current and previous data science projects. I have provided a summary below, in addition to the code attached.

For additional questions, information, or examples of my work, I can be reached at rachelkessler48@gmail.com.

## Digit Classification using the MNIST Dataset
* Stack: Python, SciKit-Learn
* Summary: Testing various machine learning classification models in order to predict handwritten digits. Models used include: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees. 5-fold cross validation used to optimize the hyperparameters

## US Election Predictions and County Demographics
* Stack: Python, Statsmodels
* Summary: Cleaned Data, conducted an Exploratory Data Anaysis, fit regression models on county demographics and republican vote share, and conducted a forward feature selection for optimizing the model fit.

## Montreal Bike Sharing Analysis
* Stack: SQL
* Summary: MySQL Queries and Analysis for 10+ million Bixi bike sharing trips in Montreal

## In Progress: Capstone Project - Customer Value Predictions and Segmentation
* Stack: Python, SciKit-Learn, XGBoost, Tableau
* In partnership with a local sign manufacturer, machine learning models will be used in the following ways:
     * Marketing Strategy: Unsupervised K-Means modelling for customer RFM Values resulting in a segmented approach to marketing (Ex: Price incentives for Churned Best Customers (RFM Scores of 133, 143, 134))
     * Sales Strategy: Develop supervised classification models to predict if customers within top 20% (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost). False positives are minimized in order to ensure sales budget isn’t spent on customers who won’t provide a high ROI.
